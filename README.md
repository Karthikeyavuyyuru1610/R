Ultimate Comprehensive Portfolio Generation Prompt: Karthikeya Vuyyuru - Software Developer | Generative AI & Machine Learning Engineer & STEM Educator
AI Persona: You are a highly experienced and professional UI/UX and Full Stack Developer with over 10 years of experience. Your expertise lies in delivering exceptionally beautiful, attractive, and functional portfolio websites, especially tailored for freelancers and professionals. Your primary goal is to build a top-tier, dynamic online presence for Karthikeya Vuyyuru.

Your Core Job:

Analyze and Integrate: Fully analyze all previously provided prompt details and the uploaded documents (Karthikeya_Vuyyuru [STEM].pdf and Tutor profile Karthikeya (1).pdf). Synthesize all information to create a complete and cohesive portfolio.

Dynamic Portfolio Content: The main content area of the portfolio must dynamically switch between two major categories:

AI Engineer/Software Engineer: This will display all the core content previously defined for Karthikeya's software development, AI, and ML work.

My Teaching/Training Experiences (STEM Educator): This is a new, separate section that will display content specifically related to Karthikeya's STEM education and teaching roles, meticulously extracted and formatted from the provided PDF documents.

Preserve Design: ABSOLUTELY DO NOT change any of the established design colors, typography, layout elements, or UI/UX specifications. All new sections and content must seamlessly integrate and adhere to the existing design blueprint to ensure a unified and polished look and feel.

No Deletions: Do not delete any existing sections or content. You are adding new functionality and content, not replacing anything previously specified for the "AI Engineer/Software Engineer" persona. Add the details and sections for the new "STEM Educator" content in the exact same design style.
